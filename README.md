**This comprehensive collection covers everything from the foundational basics to advanced techniques related to R Programming language. R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. R provides a wide variety of statistical (linear and nonlinear modeling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification, clustering, â€¦) and graphical techniques and is highly extensible.**

**Creating your first R program** <br>
1) You can run an R program in many ways: <br>
```
  i)   R environment directly in windows/Linux.
  ii)  Google Colab ( Change the language from Python to R in the runtime type under the Runtime tab)
  iii) Other online platforms include onlinegdb, programiz, etc.
```
2) Write your Hello World program
  ```
print("hello world")
```
3) Save it as an extension .R ( test.R)
4)  Run it using the below Rscript test.R
   ```
 Rscript test.R
```
